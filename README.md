# Classification Web App

This Streamlit web application allows users to explore different classifiers on three datasets: Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine. It supports three classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The app provides insights into dataset characteristics, including PCA plots, confusion matrices, and classification reports to evaluate classifier performance.

## Usage

- Choose a dataset from the sidebar using the 'Select Dataset' dropdown.
- Explore dataset characteristics in the sidebar.
- Select a classifier from the 'Select Classifier' dropdown.
- Adjust classifier parameters in the sidebar if necessary.
- View classifier results, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## About

This application supports three datasets: Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine. The available classifiers are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots provide insights into the dataset, while confusion matrices and classification reports help evaluate classifier performance.
