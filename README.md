# Classification Web App

This Streamlit web application allows users to explore different classifiers on three datasets: Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine. It supports three classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The app provides insights into dataset characteristics, including PCA plots, confusion matrices, and classification reports to evaluate classifier performance.
